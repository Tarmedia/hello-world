SellBloc smart contracts and big data for investor incubator
I'm a trader in the crypto space and I'm starting a new venture that will align startups with business development and funding from investors all done with smart contracts on the blockchain
This project has now changed to:A Decentralized Autonomous Business Development Network on The Blockchain
A Decentralized Autonomous  Business Development Network for the Arts: Independent Music, Film/Video, Journalism,  Employment opportunities & Crowd Funding.  

SellBloc's private blockchain uses ethereum smart conntracts and a crypto token called TAR.  The technology is to assist artists in securing business opportunities(B2B) and public collaborations(B2C) while having access to savvy online tools like budiness development process, programmatic marketing, branding and social media. 
Not only will the network provide an environment to sell product and services but will be a collaboratyion space of sorts with access to savvy tools like big data, programmatic marketing, social media and more.  
The network itself will be known as vEnt 0001.  Each node will be called a "cell"
Everything required to access information effectively and deliver quality products and services  in the digital internet of things. 
This is the online version of a performance space to come in the brick and mortar world
